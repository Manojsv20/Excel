Here you will see an excel file preview of monthly income and expenses. You need to create a similar-looking excel file. 

Keep the following in mind:

1) Use separate table objects for income and expenses.
2) For totals in both tables, you can use the inbuilt Excel table total feature.
3) Use conditional formatting to highlight monthly savings when they are below the monthly savings target that is specified at the top.
4) You can add additional income and expense items. Also, fill out your own real expenses in this sheet on an ongoing basis so that you can track your monthly savings.
5) In case you don't have an income right now, do this for your friend or family member.
